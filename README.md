# Geometric Texture Synthesis by Example


Given inputs are -> two objects 'input A' and 'input B' which define the input analogy and an object 'output A'. <br>
Output are -> An object 'output B' such that its shape is simiar to 'output A' and the 3d analogy followed by 'input A' and 'input B' is also followed by 'output A' and 'output B' <br>

## Pattern 1 (Single Spike pattern)

Input A - <br>
